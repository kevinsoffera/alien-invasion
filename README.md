# alien-invasion
The Alien Invasion game is made using Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course (2nd ed).
The book goes through step-by-step offering a tutorial and explanation for each concept
that is being used to build the program. It also offers further customization once
the project is finished.
Project finished on 9/18/2021 - Ended up skipping many of the exercises in chapters 
12, 13, and 14. These offer extra customizations/improvements to Alien Invasion as well
as other standalone games/programs to practice using pygame. 
In the spirit of finishing and moving on to learn new things, I have skipped them
but would be interested in further practice at some other point. Any exercises
not directly related to Alien Invasion will go under my 'crash_course_exercises'
repository.
